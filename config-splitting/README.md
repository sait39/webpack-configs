# Webpack Code Splitting

Webpack-merge allows us to split our webpack config
It's nice to have multiple configs, so things could possibly be
organized more neatly.

Having one big file could probably suck.

If this does not work or make sense because of the way the
webpack config is structured, then I webpack configs kind of suck.
